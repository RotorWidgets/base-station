Features
--------

- [ ] Event management
- [ ] Real time telemetry from race multi rotors
- [ ] Race rule/structure builder ( new race types and logic! )
- [ ] Live view of racers on track
- [ ] Ability to run on a raspberry pi or similar single board system

Any feature that requires real time data will need a specialized transponder that communicates wirelessly to the base station.

The goal is to provide a system that is backwards compatible with older lap timing systems, but also provide new functionality to make new race types and analytics easier to obtain.
